### Binary Numbers

Binary represents 1 and 0 which is relative to the electric current to the electrical component ex: if a transistor has a electric current its binary data is 1 and when there is no electrical current the binary data is 0

### Data Compression

Data compression is a method of preserving data where data is algrotimically compressed and made so to take up less space after which it can be uncompressed and enable access to all data once again ex: when we zip a file we actually compress the data to take up less space

### Extracting Information from Data

Extracting Information from Data is when a dataset is present and the goal is to extract as much information from said database as efficently and effectively while making sure that the data being tracked is not in any way incomplete, corrupt, invalid or duplicate ex: when big companies analzye user data they have to make sure that their dataset has no invalid data and they analyze the data to figure out if there are any improvents that could be made to refine their user's experience

### Using Programs with Data 

Using Programs with Data is the process of extracting information from data while using programs to automate the process using programs data is able to be processed much faster and efficently while using up less human labour, by using programs important information can be highlighted and used for research or imporvement ex: a company can use programs with data to analyze a huge dataset while not using a single person to extract information from data
